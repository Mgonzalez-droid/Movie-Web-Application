 <h1>Welcome,</h1>
 <p>In this section we plan to clearly describe our motivations to complete a Movie web app. This will allow us to present our project in more clarity before moving into the detailed UI Design and ER Diagram. Our motivation to create a Movie Web app serves to not only join our joint passion for movies but to describe movie review data in a trend analysis manner. We plan on addressing the best films to watch through queries that clearly demonstrate films to watch based on genre and several other attributes outlined in our unique queries. This is a way that no movie review website has done as of yet. The trend data we plan to visualize to the end user will be in the reiterated queries below. In addition to the queries described below we plan on implementing a fluid web User Interface (UI) that allows the end user to create reviews in the database and review data trends that will update as users complete their own reviews. This availability is a unique experience the end user will not be able to achieve elsewhere.</p>
