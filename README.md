# Introduction:
This is new version of the web app is alot more lightwight in my opinnion, this removes all the use
of ruby and replaces it with the core necessary web languages needed for this project: HTML, CSS,
and Javascript. The webserver is initiated with apache tomcat. Stating this webserver as you will
see is much simpler and can be done without any additional install or setup. All that is required
is a recent install of Java.
